QUESTION: What is the main difference between a `<p>` tag and a `<div>` tag in HTML?","output_text":"<h3>The Difference Between `<p>` and `<div>`</h3><p>That's an excellent question! The key difference lies in their semantic meaning and how they are used.</p><ul><li>The <strong>`<p>`</strong> tag is for paragraphs. You should use it when you are marking up a block of text that is a distinct paragraph. It tells the browser, \"This is a self-contained block of text.\" By default, browsers add some space before and after a paragraph.</li><li>The <strong>`<div>`</strong> tag, or division tag, is a generic container. It has no semantic meaning on its own. Its main purpose is to group other elements together so you can style them with CSS or manipulate them with JavaScript. You might use a `<div>` to group a heading, a paragraph, and an image together to create a card component.</li></ul><p><strong>In short:</strong> Use `<p>` for text paragraphs and `<div>` for grouping and layout.</p>"}

{"input_text":"CONTEXT: The lesson is on Color Theory. QUESTION: Can you explain the concept of complementary colors using an analogy?","output_text":"<h3>Complementary Colors: An Analogy</h3><p>Of course! Think of complementary colors as best friends who are total opposites but bring out the best in each other.</p><p>Imagine two friends: one is very loud, energetic, and loves being the center of attention (like the color <strong>Orange</strong>). The other is calm, quiet, and thoughtful (like the color <strong>Blue</strong>).</p><p>When they are apart, they are just one way. But when you see them together, their differences make each of them stand out even more. The energetic friend seems even more vibrant next to the calm one, and the calm one seems even more serene and cool next to the energetic one.</p><p>Complementary colors work the same way. When you place them side-by-side, like blue and orange, or red and green, they create the strongest possible contrast and make each other look brighter and more intense. They complete each other!</p>"}
{"input_text":"QUESTION: What is photosynthesis?","output_text":"<h3>What is Photosynthesis?</h3><p>Photosynthesis is the amazing process that plants use to turn sunlight, water, and air into their food. Think of it as a plant's way of cooking!</p><ol><li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Plants take in water through their roots and carbon dioxide (a gas from the air) through tiny pores in their leaves.</li><li><strong>Energy Source:</strong> They use sunlight as the energy to power the 'cooking' process. A special substance in their leaves called chlorophyll, which is what makes plants green, captures this sunlight.</li><li><strong>The Result:</strong> The plant converts these ingredients into a type of sugar called glucose, which is its food. As a very important byproduct, it also releases oxygen—the air we need to breathe!</li></ol><p>So, in simple terms: Sunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide = Plant Food (Sugar) + Oxygen.</p>"}
